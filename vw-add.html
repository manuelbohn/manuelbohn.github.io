        <h1>A Global Developmental Psychology</h1>
        <h1>Two Research Assistant positions in Turkey</h1>

        <p>We are looking for two research assistants to work on a cross-cultural research project for 3 years. This is a great opportunity for recent graduates or graduate students to gain research experience.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The project investigates the longitudinal development of socio-communicative abilities in children between three and five years of age in three cultural settings: Germany, Turkey, Kenya (PI: Prof. Dr. Manuel Bohn). The project is hosted by Leuphana University Lüneburg in Germany and is generously funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. The project follows a large sample of children from each setting (~100 per setting) for two years. At age 3, 4, and 5, children complete a battery of tasks assessing social-cognitive, pragmatic, and language abilities. In addition, we record children’s everyday experiences using wearable cameras. The goal is to better understand the similarities and differences in socio-communicative development between different cultural settings and how they relate to children’s everyday experiences.</p>

        <p>The RA will be based in Turkey (the post does not require residing in Germany. Travelling will only involve short trips to Germany and Kenya to meet with the research team).</p>

            <li>Good management skills</li>
